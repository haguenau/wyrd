Wyrd ChangeLog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2013-02-02     Release 1.4.6:

    * Fixed a failure to quote filenames in the editor commands provided by
      the default wyrdrc.

    * Fixed a crash when the terminal is resized while wyrd is executing an
      external editor or browser.  (In some environments, this would happen
      every time a reminder file is edited.)

    * Fixed 'configure' errors when compiling with OCaml 4.

    * Added Oasis metadata.

    * Added automatic refresh of the display when reminder files are modified.

    * Added a backtrace printout for unhandled exceptions.

    * Fixed a parallel-make race conditoin resulting from integration of
      upstream ocaml-curses.

    * Fixed a crash when the terminal is resized.

    * Fixed some crashes which could be triggered by pressing arrow keys or
      entering non-printable characters from the "quick add" entry field.

2010-10-23     Release 1.4.5:

    * Switched from personal fork of OCaml curses bindings to the
      community-maintained library from http://www.nongnu.org/ocaml-tmk/ .

    * Fixed bug which prevented "quick add" feature from accepting UTF-8
      encoded text.

    * Implemented improved support for Remind's new "reminder directory"
      capability.

2008-02-21     Release 1.4.4:

    * Fixed an instance of insecure tempfile creation.  This addresses a
      security vulnerability that had the potential to cause data loss.

2007-08-17     Release 1.4.3:

    * Modified the configure script to support weird locations of ncurses
      term.h .

    * Deprecated the 'calendar_selection' colorable object.  For consistency
      with the rest of the Wyrd interface, the selected calendar day is now
      rendered in reverse video.

    * Added the 'untimed_bold' configuration variable for selecting between
      normal and boldface rendering of untimed reminders.

    * Added support for remind's 'filedir()' function within INCLUDE
      directives, for those who like to "INCLUDE
      [filedir()]/some-extra-reminders".  Thanks to Stefan Wehr for the patch.
               
    * Implemented more extensive shell-expansion of filenames specified within
      wyrdrc, enabling the use of idioms like 'set
      reminders_file="$DOT_REMINDERS"'.

    * Added support for Remind 3.1.0 advance warning of reminders throughout
      the Wyrd interface, enabled via the 'advance_warning' configuration
      variable.

    * Support new Remind 3.1.0 date formatting.

2007-05-25     Release 1.4.2:

    * Added the untimed_window_width rcfile option, which lets the user set
      the width of the windows on the right side of the display.
               
    * Tweaked the resize handler so Wyrd does not completely die when the
      terminal is resized too small.
               
    * Made modifications to support rendering UTF-8 reminders (requires
      ncurses built with wide char support)

    * the home_sticky option, allowing the cursor position to automatically
      track the current time.

    * Added command-line option to append reminders using the natural language
      parser.

    * Eliminated dependence on Bash-style tilde expansion.

2006-07-16     Release 1.4.1:

    * Fixed the "blank screen" bug that resulted from I/O buffering
      synchronization issues.

    * Fixed an error with registering certain color schemes.  

    * Corrected typo in the word "July".  

    * Added the 'quick_date_US' option, allowing users to choose between
      "month first" or "day first" conventions when entering quick reminders
      with numeric dates.

2006-06-26     Release 1.4.0:

    * Added the 'default' color specifier, which accesses the default terminal
      foreground and background colors.  (A 'default' background color also
      enables background transparency on terminal emulators which support it.)
               
    * Reduced the minimum terminal height to 23 lines, so screen(1) users
      should always be able to use a status bar.

    * Fixed a bug that caused events with zero duration to overlap.
      Implemented "quick reminder" command, allowing the user to quickly
      describe an event using natural language (USA English, at least).

    * Changed the substitution strings used within wyrdrc, to prevent
      namespace collisions with Remind's substitution filter.  (This breaks
      compatibility with old wyrdrc files.)

    * Corrected a bug in the chronological ordering of untimed reminders.

    * Added some checks to prevent scrolling outside the acceptable date
      range.

    * Implemented optional ISO-8601 week numbering.  Made some corrections to
      the coloring code.

    * Code cleanup.  

    * Remind errors are now handled somewhat sanely.  

2006-02-24     Release 1.3.0:

    * Set the default editor to $EDITOR.  

    * Errors are now detected when launching an editor.  

    * Improved the Remind version detection within the build script.  

    * Implemented the 'goto' operation, which allows the user to manually
      enter a date and then jump immediately to that day.  The boolean option
      'goto_big_endian' selects whether dates are represented using YYYYMMDD
      or DDMMYYYY format.

    * Implemented the 'cut', 'copy', and 'paste' operations, which provide a
      convenient interface to duplicate or reschedule reminders.

    * The 'edit_any' command now spawns a selection dialog only when the user
      has multiple reminder files.

2005-11-20     Release 1.2.0:

    * Added the 'busy_algorithm' and 'untimed_duration' configuration
      variables, which can be used to set the algorithm for determining the
      "busy" level for each day on the month calendar.  There are two
      algorithms to choose from: count number of triggered reminders per day,
      or count number of hours of reminders per day.

    * The configuration script now checks for acceptable versions of OCaml and
      Remind.

    * Corrected the build script to support parallel make once again.  

    * Replaced the deprecated "tail -1" syntax in the configure script.

    * Fixed an off-by-one error in the resize handler, which could cause the
      Wyrd status line to appear on two different lines.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause find_next and next_reminder to fail.

    * Added the configuration variable 'remind_command', which can be used to
      specify the Remind executable.

    * The current date and time are now highlighted within the month calendar
      and timed reminders window, according to the color values set for
      'calendar_today' and 'timed_current'.  (The selected date is now
      highlighted in the calendar window according to the 'calendar_selection'
      setting, rather than the 'calendar_today' setting.)

    * If there are multiple reminders listed in the message window, they are
      now sorted by starting timestamp.

    * Wyrd now chooses tempfile names that are unique for each user.  

    * Added the 'help' command, which generates a list of all keybindings.

2005-09-21     Release 1.1.1:

    * Updated the build script to support the NetBSD environment.  

    * Implemented a built-in calendar layout algorithm, and removed the
      dependence on cal(1).

2005-09-15     Release 1.1.0:

    * Implemented the 'next_reminder' command, which jumps forward to the next
      reminder in chronological order.

    * Made 'search_next' more robust--certain edge cases are now handled
      better.

    * Improved the alignment of timestamps in the reminder description window.

    * Fixed a typo in the short string representation for Tuesday.  

    * Implemented the 'view_week' and 'view_month' commands, which view
      Remind's formatted weekly or monthly calendars for the selected date.

    * Implemented the 'edit_any' command and associated 'edit_any_template',
      which can be used to edit a reminder file without selecting any
      particular reminder.
               
    * The untimed reminders window now accepts focus even when there are no
      untimed reminders.

    * Executing the 'edit' command on a blank timeslot now creates a new timed
      reminder.  Hitting 'edit' on a blank untimed reminders list creates a
      new untimed reminder.
               
    * Added support for 'nodisplay' and 'noweight' TAG parameters, which can
      be used to suppress display of reminders or give them no weight when
      determining the "busy level" colorations on the month calendar.

    * Removed nonsensical DURATION specifiers from default weekly and monthly
      untimed reminder templates.
               
    * Added the 'center_cursor' option, which can be used to fix the cursor in
      the center of the timed reminders window while scrolling.

    * Fixed an assertion failure caused by entering an unprintable character
      in a search string.

2005-06-23     Release 1.0.0:

    * Added a screen refresh function.  

    * Implemented overlapping timed reminders and associated routines for
      handling multiple reminders in a single timeslot.  Colorable object
      'timed_reminder' has been deprecated in favor of 'timed_reminder1'
      through 'timed_reminder4', so that overlapping reminders can be given
      different colors.

    * Corrected the disappearing cursor bug associated with jumping between
      days with differing numbers of untimed reminders.

2005-05-04     Release 0.3.0:

    * Converted the documentation to LaTeX format, with PDF, HTML, and manpage
      targets.

    * Added "new_*_dialog" commands for creating new reminders.  These
      commands will generate a selection dialog for choosing which reminder
      file to add the new reminder to.

    * Added a bunch of generic user-defined reminder templates.  By default,
      some of these are configured to generate weekly and monthly reminders.

    * Added a beep and error message when pressing an unbound key.  

    * Start and end times in the description window had been rendered
      according to the value of schedule_12_hour; now they are rendered
      according to the value of new variable description_12_hour .

    * a rare bug that could cause timed reminders to become temporarily
      invisible at month boundaries.

    * Optimized rendering of timed reminders window when scrolling (should be
      a little smoother now on slow hardware).

2005-04-26     Release 0.2.0:

    * Made colors configurable via the rcfile.  

    * Made time representation (12/24 hour) configurable via the rcfile.

    * Implemented external viewing of triggered reminders ("rem -q -g") via
      less(1).

    * Added a resize handler.  

    * Added a configuration variable to switch the first day of the week
      between Sunday and Monday.

    * Wyrd now accepts an optional reminders file as a command-line parameter.

2005-04-16     Release 0.1.3:

    * A more suitable error message is generated when trying to run Wyrd on
      terminals without color support.

    * Wyrd now discards exceptions due to errors on curs_set(), which is not
      supported in all terminals.

    * Made installation script portable to BSD install(1).  

2005-04-15     Release 0.1.2:

    * Upon further investigation, cpp appears to be completely broken on OS X.
      Wyrd now ships with pre-preprocessed ML files.

2005-04-15     Release 0.1.1:

    * Changed invocations of 'cpp' to 'cpp -P' to correct compilation errors
      on OS X, maybe others.

2005-04-15     Release 0.1.0:

    * Initial release.
